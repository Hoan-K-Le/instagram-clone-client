## Technologies Used

This app was built using mongodb, express, react and node.js.
The styling was done using tailwind.

## Aproach

We began by planning out the routes and setting up a client side and server side.  Next we mob coded the backend.  We split up the front end and implemented changes and fixed bugs little by little.  Finally we tackled the styling using tailwind.

## Hurdles

There were sometimes that fixing one piece of the site would break another.  Working together to smoothe out all the wrinkles was a challenge, especially towards the end.  The final product was well worth the struggle.
